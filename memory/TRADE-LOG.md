### 2026-06-04 BUY NVDA — open
- Side: buy
- Shares: 11
- Entry price: $218.89 (actual fill)
- Stop level: $192.61 (12% trailing GTC, live)
- Target: $271.42 (3:1 R/R on 8% risk)
- Catalyst: Tech is the week's leading S&P sector (IT +3.75%); NVDA trading near 52-week highs.
- Thesis: Highest-conviction, most-liquid momentum leader (0.16% spread) chosen as the offensive engine of a diversified starter pair. NOTE: discretionary OPERATOR-OVERRIDE entry — placed with the market-regime filter OFF (S&P 7,553.68 below its 20-day SMA 7,591.22) and WITHOUT verifying the breakout-within-5-days / 3–8% pullback / 1.5x-volume gates (no bars data available). Not a strategy-qualified setup.
- Earnings next: ~2026-08-26 (est., unverified — clears the 10-trading-day gate)
- Time stop: 2026-06-25 (15 trading days)

### 2026-06-04 BUY CVX — open
- Side: buy
- Shares: 13
- Entry price: $189.54 (actual fill)
- Stop level: $166.81 (12% trailing GTC, live)
- Target: $235.03 (3:1 R/R on 8% risk)
- Catalyst: Energy is the week's #2 S&P sector (+3.17%); CVX trading near 52-week highs.
- Thesis: Lower-beta, tight-spread (0.05%) energy name added as ballast to diversify away from tech-correlated drawdown in the starter pair. NOTE: discretionary OPERATOR-OVERRIDE entry — placed with the market-regime filter OFF and WITHOUT verifying the breakout/pullback/volume gates. Not a strategy-qualified setup.
- Earnings next: ~2026-08-07 (est., unverified — clears the 10-trading-day gate)
- Time stop: 2026-06-25 (15 trading days)

## 2026-06-04 — EOD Snapshot
Equity: $99,976.39 | Cash: $95,128.19 | Day P&L: -$23.61 (-0.02%) | Phase P&L: -$23.61 (-0.02%)
Trades today: 2 | Trades this week: 2/3 | Regime: OFF

| Symbol | Shares | Entry    | Current  | Unreal. P&L      | Stop type        |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| NVDA   | 11     | $218.89  | $218.15  | -$8.14 (-0.34%)  | 12% trailing GTC |
| CVX    | 13     | $189.54  | $188.35  | -$15.47 (-0.63%) | 12% trailing GTC |

Notes: First live trading day on the $100k paper account. Operator-authorized one-time override opened a diversified starter pair (NVDA tech, CVX energy) despite the regime filter being OFF (S&P below its 20-day SMA). Both positions closed marginally red on the day but are well within normal noise and each is protected by a live 12% trailing-stop GTC order. Equity essentially flat at -0.02%. Regime remains OFF, so no new buys until S&P reclaims its 20-day SMA; manage the two open names via standard sell-side rules. Phase/day P&L computed off the live $100k base, not the illustrative $10k.

## 2026-06-08 — EOD Snapshot
Equity: $99,883.89 | Cash: $95,128.18 | Day P&L: -$92.50 (-0.09%) | Phase P&L: -$116.11 (-0.12%)
Trades today: 0 | Trades this week: 0/3 | Regime: ON

| Symbol | Shares | Entry    | Current  | Unreal. P&L       | Stop type        |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| CVX    | 13     | $189.54  | $189.24  | -$3.90 (-0.16%)   | 12% trailing GTC |
| NVDA   | 11     | $218.89  | $208.69  | -$112.20 (-4.66%) | 12% trailing GTC |

Notes: Quiet Monday — no trades (new week, 0/3). Regime ON per the most recent (6/5) research read; no fresh 6/8 pre-market run, so that status is carried forward. Both positions held and protected by live 12% trailing-stop GTC orders (CVX stop $168.11 / hwm $191.03; NVDA stop $195.01 / hwm $221.60); neither is near the -8% cut (NVDA -4.66%, CVX -0.16%). Caveat on Day P&L: Friday 6/5's EOD snapshot was never appended, so this figure is measured against the 6/4 snapshot ($99,976.39) and effectively spans two trading days; against Alpaca's actual prior close ($99,819.31) the account is +$64.58 (+0.06%) on the day alone. Equity essentially flat. Outlook: hold both names and manage by standard sell-side rules — keep an eye on CVX given the ~10% oil drop and NVDA given tech rotation. Phase/day P&L computed off the live $100k base, not the illustrative $10k.
