### 2026-06-04 BUY NVDA — open
- Side: buy
- Shares: 11
- Entry price: $218.89 (actual fill)
- Stop level: $192.61 (12% trailing GTC, live)
- Target: $271.42 (3:1 R/R on 8% risk)
- Catalyst: Tech is the week's leading S&P sector (IT +3.75%); NVDA trading near 52-week highs.
- Thesis: Highest-conviction, most-liquid momentum leader (0.16% spread) chosen as the offensive engine of a diversified starter pair. NOTE: discretionary OPERATOR-OVERRIDE entry — placed with the market-regime filter OFF (S&P 7,553.68 below its 20-day SMA 7,591.22) and WITHOUT verifying the breakout-within-5-days / 3–8% pullback / 1.5x-volume gates (no bars data available). Not a strategy-qualified setup.
- Earnings next: ~2026-08-26 (est., unverified — clears the 10-trading-day gate)
- Time stop: 2026-06-25 (15 trading days)

### 2026-06-04 BUY CVX — open
- Side: buy
- Shares: 13
- Entry price: $189.54 (actual fill)
- Stop level: $166.81 (12% trailing GTC, live)
- Target: $235.03 (3:1 R/R on 8% risk)
- Catalyst: Energy is the week's #2 S&P sector (+3.17%); CVX trading near 52-week highs.
- Thesis: Lower-beta, tight-spread (0.05%) energy name added as ballast to diversify away from tech-correlated drawdown in the starter pair. NOTE: discretionary OPERATOR-OVERRIDE entry — placed with the market-regime filter OFF and WITHOUT verifying the breakout/pullback/volume gates. Not a strategy-qualified setup.
- Earnings next: ~2026-08-07 (est., unverified — clears the 10-trading-day gate)
- Time stop: 2026-06-25 (15 trading days)
